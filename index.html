                <h1>About me</h1>
                <h2>Hi, I'm Julio De Castro future software developer</h2>
                <p>I was a former construction worker who loves to code on my free time. I have always been wanting to become a programmer that's why I decided to enroll myself in George Brown's T177 program
                    in the mids of this pandemic. The reason why is because I wanted to have a great future proof career, and also travel the world while working; and programming is the only job that can do that.
                    I also do CTFs just for fun and also to hone my penetration testing skills, as it is not fun, but it can potentially secure me a job if ever I want to follow that discipline. I hope you enjoy this 
                    website I made as a school project!
